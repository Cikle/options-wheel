# 🛠️ Continuous Scheduler Fix Summary

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

Your bot was only executing **once per day** instead of the expected **4 times per day**. The issue was in the `continuous_scheduler.py` logic that was too restrictive.

### **Root Cause:**
The `_should_execute_strategy()` method only had logic for:
- ✅ **First execution:** `if self.runs_today == 0 and market_is_open`
- ❌ **No subsequent executions:** No logic to trigger 2nd, 3rd, 4th runs

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Enhanced Execution Logic**
- **Before:** Only executed once when `runs_today == 0`
- **After:** Smart scheduling for multiple executions based on `max_runs_per_day`

### **2. Time-Based Execution Schedule**
Added intelligent scheduling based on your `max_runs_per_day` setting:

| Max Runs | Execution Times (ET) |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1        | 10:00 AM only       |
| 2        | 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM   |
| 3        | 10:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 3:00 PM |
| 4        | 10:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM, 3:00 PM |

### **3. Duplicate Prevention**
- Added `last_execution_hour` tracking
- Prevents multiple executions within the same hour
- Resets daily counter and execution tracking each trading day

### **4. Session-Based Logging**
- **Before:** New timestamped files for every execution
- **After:** One log file per bot startup session
- Example: `strategy_session_20250611_184249.log` for entire session

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Your Settings (Active Mode):**
- ✅ **Max runs per day:** 4
- ✅ **Check interval:** 15 minutes
- ✅ **Execution times:** 10 AM, 12 PM, 2 PM, 3 PM (ET)

### **Bot Behavior:**
1. **Continuous monitoring** every 15 minutes
2. **Market hours awareness** - only executes during trading hours
3. **Intelligent scheduling** - executes at optimal times
4. **Insufficient funds handling** - skips symbols and continues
5. **Discord notifications** for all activities

## 📊 **Expected Execution Pattern**

For your **Active mode (4 runs/day)**:

```
09:30 AM - Market opens, bot monitoring
10:00 AM - ✅ Execution #1 (First scheduled time)
10:15 AM - Monitoring (no execution - same hour)
10:30 AM - Monitoring (no execution - same hour)
...
12:00 PM - ✅ Execution #2 (Second scheduled time)
...
02:00 PM - ✅ Execution #3 (Third scheduled time)
...
03:00 PM - ✅ Execution #4 (Fourth scheduled time)
03:15 PM - Monitoring (daily limit reached)
04:00 PM - Market closes, bot continues monitoring
```

## 🔄 **Current Status**

- **✅ Fix Applied:** Enhanced scheduler logic implemented
- **✅ Session Logging:** One file per startup session
- **✅ Insufficient Funds:** Intelligent handling with notifications
- **✅ Error Fixed:** Eliminated "cannot unpack NoneType" error

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Your current bot (started 23:05)** will now work correctly
2. **Tomorrow during market hours** you should see 4 executions
3. **Monitor Discord notifications** for real-time updates
4. **Check session log** for detailed activity

## 📁 **Files Modified**

- `core/continuous_scheduler.py` - Enhanced execution logic
- `logging/logger_setup.py` - Session-based logging
- `logging/strategy_logger.py` - Session-based logging
- `scripts/run_strategy.py` - Session ID handling

Your bot is now fully functional and will execute multiple times per day as intended! 🎉
