## Session-Based Logging Implementation Summary

### Problem
The options wheel bot was creating a new log file for every strategy execution, resulting in multiple small files throughout the day in continuous mode. This made it difficult to track the full session logs.

### Solution
Implemented **session-based logging** that creates one log file per bot startup session, shared across all strategy executions during that session.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced `logger_setup.py`
- Added `session_id` parameter to `setup_logger()` function
- When `session_id` is provided, creates files named `strategy_session_{session_id}.log`
- Falls back to timestamp-based naming when no session_id provided

#### 2. Enhanced `strategy_logger.py` 
- Added `session_id` parameter to `StrategyLogger.__init__()`
- When `session_id` is provided, creates files named `strategy_session_{session_id}.json`
- Falls back to timestamp-based naming when no session_id provided

#### 3. Updated `run_strategy.py`
- In continuous mode, generates a single session_id at startup
- Passes session_id to both logger types for consistent file naming
- All strategy executions in that session use the same log files

#### 4. Fixed Discord Notification Issues
- Corrected indentation error in `send_trade_notification()` method
- All Discord notifications now working correctly

### File Naming Examples

**Before (multiple files per day):**
```
strategy_20250611_090000.log
strategy_20250611_120000.log  
strategy_20250611_150000.log
strategy_20250611_180000.log
strategy_log_20250611_090000.json
strategy_log_20250611_120000.json
strategy_log_20250611_150000.json
strategy_log_20250611_180000.json
```

**After (one file per session):**
```
strategy_session_20250611_085930.log      # All log messages for entire session
strategy_session_20250611_085930.json     # All strategy data for entire session
```

### Benefits
1. **Single comprehensive log file** per bot run session
2. **Easier troubleshooting** - all related logs in one place
3. **Reduced file clutter** in logs directory
4. **Better continuity tracking** across multiple strategy executions
5. **Backwards compatible** - single executions still work normally

### Usage
- **Continuous Mode**: Automatically uses session-based logging
- **Single Execution**: Uses timestamp-based logging (unchanged behavior)
- **Log files contain**: All executions from bot startup until shutdown

### Testing Status
✅ All system tests passing  
✅ Discord notifications working  
✅ Session-based logging confirmed working  
✅ Insufficient funds handling implemented  
✅ Duplicate notification issues resolved
